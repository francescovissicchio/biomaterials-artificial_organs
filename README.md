# biomaterials-artificial_organs
This repository is about a university project me and my collegues were working on. We successfully reproduced the Decuzzi&amp;Ferrari model with a intresting variation in the formulation of the substrate. We were intrested in seeing how the adhesion energy changed in relationship with the change of the substrate.

Here's the link to the Decuzzi&Ferrari paper:
