This repository is about a university project me and my collegues are working on. We're aiming at reproducing the Decuzzi&amp;Ferrari model with a intresting variation in the formulation of the substrate. We're intrested in seeing how the adhesion energy vary.

Here's the link to the Decuzzi&Ferrari paper:
